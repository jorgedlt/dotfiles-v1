# dotfiles
My Dot Files - With Generics plus MACos, AWS. GDP tweaks

`.dotfiles` are how you configure and personalize your unix based system. This repo contains dot files I am using.

This repository is not meant to be used directly. `.dotfiles` are private, hence there is a small chance that mine will perfectly fit yours. -- Fork it, change it to suit your needs. That's it.

## What's inside

Everything is regrouped by topic areas. Such as `bash`, `git`, `osx` or `vim`. If you need to create a new topic, simply create a new file.

## Install

Simply run this:

    git clone https://github.com/<yourfork>/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    scripts/dot.install

## Thanks

This repository is heavily inspired from  [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)' dotfiles project. 

## Coming soon

From time to time, simply execute `dotfiles` to make sure all your dependencies are up to date.

In case you upgrade your OSX version, you can also reset your preferred default settings with `set-defaults`.
